A library is a prewritten collection of functions and code to make a set of tasks easier in a specific programming language. 
You have to include library in your html code to have access to its functions and methods. Be careful because some libraries can conflict with each other and you may need to remove a library or edit it to get them to work together.

jQuery can be used to select elements using a similar syntax to CSS. You can call a class or id. Eg. $("element name, class, id")
